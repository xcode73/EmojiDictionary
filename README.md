During development of the app, I learned how to:
- work with table views
- customize table views with custom cells
- dynamically insert and remove cells
- use static table views to present forms or other non-changing lists
- allow the user to swipe to delete cells
- persist data using Codable
- saving information to the device by archiving model data to a file saved on the disk

This app is a guided project from Develop in Swift Data Collections
